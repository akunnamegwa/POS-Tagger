# Tagger Project

## Overview
The Tagger project is a part-of-speech (POS) tagger implemented in Python. It uses the Viterbi algorithm for sequence labeling to assign POS tags to words in a given text.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/POS-Tagger.git
   cd POS-Tagger
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the POS tagger:
   ```bash
   python tagger.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter the path to the folder containing training files, the test file name, and the desired output file name.

## Project Structure
- `tagger.py`: The main POS tagging script.
- `sample_trainingfiles/`: Folder containing sample training files.
- `sample_tests/`: Folder containing sample test files.
- `sample_test_result.txt`: Sample output file generated by the POS tagger.
- `tagger_test.py`: Unit tests for the POS tagger.

## Customization
You can customize the training files, test files, and output file names within the `tagger.py` script. Additionally, you can modify the code to fine-tune the POS tagging results.

## Testing
Run the unit tests using pytest:
```bash
pytest tagger_test.py
```

## Notes
- Make sure to have Python and pip installed on your system.
- It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies.
