Detective
Chief
Inspector
John
McLeish
gazed
doubtfully
at
the
plates
before
him
.
Having
thought
he
was
hungry
,
he
now
realized
that
actually
he
needed
anything
rather
than
the
overflowing
plate
of
cholesterol
the
canteen
at
New
Scotland
Yard
had
provided
with
such
admirable
promptness
.
Sleep
would
perhaps
make
more
sense
after
thirty-six
hours
straight
on
duty
;
much
of
it
spent
with
a
sullen
Jamaican
who
had
killed
his
landlady
and
her
three
children
in
the
crowded
kitchen
of
a
house
behind
the
Westway
.
